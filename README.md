# ESG

Short url to this folder: https://ebmgt.github.io/ESG

ESG stands for Environmental, social and corporate governance ([details](https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Industrial_and_organizational_psychology#Environmental,_social_and_corporate_governance_(ESG)]))

* Regarding "Social" this includes workforce conditions.

Below is a plot of Glassdoor rankings by employees of two large companies that serially measure well-being. Note that Microsoft started measuring their well-being sometime between Ballmer leaving in 2014 and 2020 when they first publicly released results. The plots suggest that several years are needed between large organizational changes (launch of ${\color{green}Googlegeist}$; arrival of ${\color{blue}Satya\ Nadella}$) before large changes in employee reaction.

* To add large healthcare institutions to the plot, click [here](https://github.com/ebmgt/ESG/blob/main/files/HealthCare.md). Although some healthcare organizations have had intermittent success with rankings, none have sustained their success.
* To add profit margins to Google & Microsoft, click [here](https://github.com/ebmgt/ESG/blob/main/files/Plot-Glassdoor-profit_margins-no_healthcare-2023-07-15.png). This plot suggests that addressing workforce well-being is not a zero-sum conflict with profit.

Per https://www.sasb.org, metrics are:
* The entity shall separately disclose voluntary and involuntary employee turnover for physicians, for non-physician health care practitioners, and for all other employees.
* For each category of employees, the entity shall disclose the annual voluntary turnover.
* For each category of employees, the entity shall disclose the annual involuntary turnover.

More items are needed to measure. Suggestions of validated, relevant questions of workforce are at https://ebmgt.github.io/survey-inventory/
