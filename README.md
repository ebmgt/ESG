# ESG: Measurement-guided support of workforce well-being

Short url to this folder: https://ebmgt.github.io/ESG

ESG stands for Environmental, social and corporate governance and the importance of these corporate metrics was initially promoted by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan ([details from WikiDoc](https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Industrial_and_organizational_psychology#Environmental,_social_and_corporate_governance_(ESG))). "Social" includes workforce conditions. 

A de facto of measurement of workforce conditions as part of **S**ocial is [Glassdoorâ€™s Best Places to Work](https://www.glassdoor.com/Award) data that allows identifying companies that are successful with their workforces ([details]([https://github.com/ebmgt/Management_measurement/edit/main/README.md)).

## ESG metrics
The currently agreed upon measures are very basic. Per https://www.sasb.org, metrics are (IFRS Foundation, 2023):
* C-DY-330a.1. The entity shall separately disclose voluntary and involuntary employee turnover for physicians, for non-physician health care practitioners, and for all other employees.
* For each category of employees, the entity shall disclose the annual voluntary turnover.
* For each category of employees, the entity shall disclose the annual involuntary turnover.

More items are needed to measure. Suggestions of validated, relevant questions of workforce are at https://ebmgt.github.io/survey-inventory/
