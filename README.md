# ESG

Short url to this folder: https://ebmgt.github.io/ESG

ESG stands for Environmental, social and corporate governance ([details](https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Industrial_and_organizational_psychology#Environmental,_social_and_corporate_governance_(ESG)]))

* Regarding "Social" this includes workforce conditions.

Below is a plot of Glassdoor rankings by employees of two large companies that serially measure well-being. Note that Microsoft started measuring their well-being sometime between Ballmer leaving in 2014 and 2020 when they first publicly released results. The plots suggest that several years are needed between large organizational changes, such as the launch of ${\color{green}Googlegeist}$ at Google and the arrival of ${\color{blue}Satya\ Nadella}$ at Microsoft, before large changes in employee reaction.

* To add profit margins to Google & Microsoft, click [here](https://github.com/ebmgt/ESG/blob/main/files/Plot-Glassdoor-profit_margins-no_healthcare-2023-07-15.png). This plot suggests that addressing workforce well-being does not conflict with profit.

Per https://www.sasb.org, metrics are:
* The entity shall separately disclose voluntary and involuntary employee turnover for physicians, for non-physician health care practitioners, and for all other employees.
* For each category of employees, the entity shall disclose the annual voluntary turnover.
* For each category of employees, the entity shall disclose the annual involuntary turnover.

More items are needed to measure. Suggestions of validated, relevant questions of workforce are at https://ebmgt.github.io/survey-inventory/
