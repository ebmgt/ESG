# ESG

Short url to this folder: https://ebmgt.github.io/ESG

ESG stands for Environmental, social and corporate governance ([details](https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Industrial_and_organizational_psychology#Environmental,_social_and_corporate_governance_(ESG)]))

* Regarding "Social" this includes workforce conditions.

Below is a plot of Glassdoor rankings by employees of two large companies that serially measure well-being. Note that Microsoft started measuring their well-being sometime between Ballmer leaving in 2014 and 2020 when they first publicly released results. The plots suggest that several years are needed between large organizational changes, such as the launch of ${\color{green}Googlegeist}$ at Google and the arrival of ${\color{blue}Satya\ Nadella}$ at Microsoft, before large changes in employee reaction.

* To add profit margins to Google & Microsoft, click [here](https://github.com/ebmgt/ESG/blob/main/files/Plot-Glassdoor-profit_margins-2024-03-09.png). This plot suggests that addressing workforce well-being does not conflict with profit.

### The Microsoft measurement-guided interventions
#### CEO change and hotspotting to identify and help units with low "thriving"
In this example, Microsoft used employee surveys to identify a hot-spot within their organization that needed help, but then Microsoft pursued non-survey data to find the solution.
> It came in the form of extensive surveys Microsoft used to monitor employees’ attitudes....Employees reported being much less satisfied with their work-life balance than their counterparts elsewhere at the company....the ability to collect and analyze vast amounts of data about how people work, and what makes a manager effective — would turn out to hold the solution ([The New York Times, 2019]([https://pubmed.gov/27871627](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/upshot/how-to-win-neil-irwin.html))). 

### ESG metrics
Per https://www.sasb.org, metrics are:
* The entity shall separately disclose voluntary and involuntary employee turnover for physicians, for non-physician health care practitioners, and for all other employees.
* For each category of employees, the entity shall disclose the annual voluntary turnover.
* For each category of employees, the entity shall disclose the annual involuntary turnover.

More items are needed to measure. Suggestions of validated, relevant questions of workforce are at https://ebmgt.github.io/survey-inventory/
