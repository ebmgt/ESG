# ESG

Short url to this folder: https://ebmgt.github.io/ESG

ESG stands for Environmental, social and corporate governance ([details](https://www.wikidoc.org/index.php/Industrial_and_organizational_psychology#Environmental,_social_and_corporate_governance_(ESG)]))

* Regarding "Social" this includes workforce conditions.

Below is a plot of Glassdoor rankings by employees of two large companies that serially measure well-being. Note that Microsoft started measuring their well-being sometime between Ballmer leaving in 2014 and 2020 when they first publicly released results. The plots suggest that several years are needed between large organizational changes, such as the launch of ${\color{green}Googlegeist}$ at Google and the arrival of ${\color{blue}Satya\ Nadella}$ at Microsoft, before large changes in employee reaction.

### Google's measurement-guided interventions
#### Brightspotting to identify tactics of great managers: Google's Project Oxygen

### Microsoft's measurement-guided interventions
#### Brightspotting to identify tactics of great managers
> Over the years, I’ve heard a lot of anecdotes about "what makes a great manager." And while many of those anecdotes are logical, it wasn't until recently that the HR Business Insights team at Microsoft has been able to use data to quantify some of these hypotheses ([Klinghoffer, 2018](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/managers-like-box-chocolates-dawn-klinghoffer/))

#### Hotspotting to identify and help units with low "thriving"
In this example, Microsoft used employee surveys to identify a hot-spot within their organization that needed help, but then Microsoft pursued non-survey data to find the solution.
> It came in the form of extensive surveys Microsoft used to monitor employees’ attitudes....Employees reported being much less satisfied with their work-life balance than their counterparts elsewhere at the company....the ability to collect and analyze vast amounts of data about how people work, and what makes a manager effective — would turn out to hold the solution ([Irwin. The New York Times, 2019](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/upshot/how-to-win-neil-irwin.html))...To test alternate theories, they identified which teams had particularly bad survey results on work-life balance and then looked for how their work patterns differed from those of teams with average or good survey results. They mined calendar and email data to reveal what differentiated teams where people were unhappy from those where things were fine ([Irwin. How to Win in a Winner-Take-All World, 2019](https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=1250176271)).

#### The role of senior leadership
> The first—and most important step—is to engage the CEO and the senior leadership team. Microsoft’s appointment of Satya Nadella as CEO was a significant milestone for the company, and his role in culture change has been instrumental. Having a CEO and senior leaders who champion and embody culture change helps set the tone and provides a path for employees to follow ([Hogan, 2017](https://www.i4cp.com/interviews/kathleen-hogan-how-microsoft-is-transforming-its-culture)).

### ESG metrics
Per https://www.sasb.org, metrics are:
* The entity shall separately disclose voluntary and involuntary employee turnover for physicians, for non-physician health care practitioners, and for all other employees.
* For each category of employees, the entity shall disclose the annual voluntary turnover.
* For each category of employees, the entity shall disclose the annual involuntary turnover.

More items are needed to measure. Suggestions of validated, relevant questions of workforce are at https://ebmgt.github.io/survey-inventory/
