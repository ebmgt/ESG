The plot below adds large healthcare institutions to the Google-Microsoft plot. Does this plot show that ESG reporting can identify healthcare institutions with successful workforce environments?

### The Mayo Clinic data is plausible
While the quality of the Glassdoor data can be challenged due to the representativeness of the volunteer respondents, the non-specifity of what is being measured, and other concerns. However, the Mayo Clinic rankings are plausible.

According to a report by Shanafelt and Noseworthy in 2017, the Mayo Clinic started serially measuring well-being in 2010 and implemented hotspotting to help selected departments:
> We began systematically measuring burnout using standardized instruments in 2010. We also regularly measure engagement and satisfaction with work-life integration.
> Historically, we assessed these dimensions every 24 months, but we switched to annual assessment in 2016.
> We benchmark these measures against national data and use the information as a barometer of organizational health...
> Although anonymous at the level of the individual, results are aggregated at the work unit level (eg, division/department) to allow executive leadership to focus attention and resources where they are most needed.
 ([Shanafelt and Noseworthy, 2017](https://pubmed.gov/27871627))

> “Fundamentally, you manage what you measure,” argues Mayo Clinic President and Chief Executive Officer John Noseworthy. “CEO performance scorecards always include financial and quality measures, but mine also has staff engagement, satisfaction, and burnout measures that are reported up to the board of trustees.”
([Wright and Katz, 2018](https://pubmed.gov/29365301))


Shanafelt left the Mayo Clinic in 2017 and Noseworthy retired in 2018.

More items are needed to measure. Suggestions, with national benchmarks for key measures, are at https://ebmgt.github.io/survey-inventory/
