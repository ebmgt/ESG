This plot adds large healthcare institutions to the Google-Microsoft plot, click [here](https://github.com/ebmgt/ESG/blob/main/files/Plot-Glassdoor-healthcare-2023-07-14.png). 

Although some healthcare organizations have had intermittent success with rankings, none have sustained their success.

### The Mayo Clinic data is plausible
While the quality of the Glassdoor data can be challenged due to the representativeness of the volunteer respondents and other concerns. However, the Mayo Clinic rankings are plausible.

According to a report by Shanafelt and Noseworthy in 2017, the Mayo Clinic started serially measuring well-being in 2010 and implemented hotspotting to help selected departments ([Shanafelt and Noseworthy, 2017](https://pubmed.gov/27871627)):
> We began systematically measuring burnout using standardized instruments in 2010. We also regularly measure engagement and satisfaction with work-life integration.
> Historically, we assessed these dimensions every 24 months, but we switched to annual assessment in 2016.
> We benchmark these measures against national data and use the information as a barometer of organizational health...
> Although anonymous at the level of the individual, results are aggregated at the work unit level (eg, division/department) to allow executive leadership to focus attention and resources where they are most needed.

Shanafelt left the Mayo Clinic in 2017 and Noseworthy retired in 2018.
