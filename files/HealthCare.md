Does this plot show that ESG reporting, or internal reporting if accompanied by focused departmental and management support, can identify healthcare institutions with successful workforce environments?

At the bottom of this page is a plot of [Glassdoor rankings](https://www.glassdoor.com/Award/Best-Places-to-Work-LST_KQ0,19.htm) by employees of:
* Two large companies, ${\color{green}Google}$ and ${\color{blue}Microsoft}$, that serially measure well-being.
* The three healthcare organizations that achieved successive years in the Glassdoor top 50. The Mayo Clinic story is instructive and available details are below.

The plots suggest that several years are needed between large organizational changes, such as the launch of ${\color{green}Googlegeist}$ surveys at Google and the arrival of ${\color{blue}Satya\ Nadella}$ at Microsoft, before large changes in employee reaction. The Google story was been detailed ([Bock, 2015](https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=1-4447-9238-5); [Garvin, 2012](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=44657)). The Microsoft story is complicated as they have had a People Analytics team since the early 2000s ([reference](https://www.myhrfuture.com/digital-hr-leaders-podcast/2019/11/19/the-evolution-of-people-analytics-at-microsoft])) but starting approximately 2002 ([reference](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/business/2012/08/microsoft-lost-mojo-steve-ballmer)) their focus included the toxic Stack Ranking of employees. Microsoft started their focus on well-being sometime between Ballmer's leaving in 2014 and 2020 when Microsoft first publicly released results. Then in 2022, Microsoft added the measurement of thriving to their existing measurement of engagement. Microsoft based this goal on the work of Spreitzer, who defined thriving as "a sense of vitality and learning" ([reference](https://doi.org/10.1002%2Fjob.756)) while Microsoft modified the definition to “be energized and empowered to do meaningful work” ([reference](https://hbr.org/2022/06/why-microsoft-measures-employee-thriving-not-engagement))

### The Mayo Clinic measurement-guided interventions in a large clinical setting
#### CEO change and hotspotting to identify and help units with low well-being within a large healthcare system
While the quality of the Glassdoor data can be challenged due to the representativeness of the volunteer respondents, the non-specificity of what is being measured, and other concerns, the Mayo Clinic rankings are plausible and the results suggest the Mayo Clinic, like Google and Microsoft, required a similar number of years after introducing major organizational change before positive impact on Glassdoor rankings occurred.

According to a report by Shanafelt and Noseworthy in 2017, the Mayo Clinic started serially measuring well-being in 2010 and implemented hotspotting to help selected departments:
> We began systematically measuring burnout using standardized instruments in 2010...Historically, we assessed these dimensions every 24 months, but we switched to annual assessment in 2016 ([Shanafelt & Noseworthy, 2017](https://pubmed.gov/27871627)). 

> Although anonymous at the level of the individual, results are aggregated at the work unit level (eg, division/department) to allow executive leadership to focus attention and resources where they are most needed ([Shanafelt & Noseworthy, 2017](https://pubmed.gov/27871627)). 

> Among the 7 Mayo Clinic work units with analyzable data that went through this process after the 2013 survey...6 of these 7 work units no longer met the criteria initially used to identify high-opportunity work units. 
 ([Shanafelt & Noseworthy, 2017](https://pubmed.gov/27871627))

> “Fundamentally, you manage what you measure,” argues Mayo Clinic President and Chief Executive Officer John Noseworthy. “CEO performance scorecards always include financial and quality measures, but mine also has staff engagement, satisfaction, and burnout measures that are reported up to the board of trustees.”
([Wright & Katz, 2018](https://pubmed.gov/29365301))

The Mayo Clinic also learned from their bright spots.

> "...we doubled down on lessons from departments that had done well with leadership development so we could make that an institutional model."
([Swensen, 2020](https://www.acr.org/-/media/ACR/Files/RLI/Podcasts/Episode-25-Swensen-Final-Transcript.pdf))

In 2014, the Mayo Clinic entered the Glassdoor top 50 ranking (see chart below). The burnout rate among physicians in the Mayo Clinic for 2016 was 33% by Maslach Burnout Inventory (high EE or high DP subscale) (Shanafelt. Mayo Clin Proc. 2017 PMID: [27871627](HTTP://pubmed.gov/27871627)).

Shanafelt left the Mayo Clinic in 2017, Noseworthy retired in 2018, and Swensen became Professor Emeritus in 2018. <!-- https://moln.org/news/431461/Nurses-as-Leaders-Broad-Acceptance-Room-to-Grow.htm -->

### St Jude data interventions
St Jude is a much smaller clinical site than the Mayo Clinic and has less than 80 beds ([source](https://www.stjude.org/about-st-jude/unique-operating-model.html#:~:text=As%20one%20of%20the%20largest,since%20we%20opened%20the%20hospital)).

St Jude began participation in the annual [survey of Great Places to work](https://fortune.com/franchise-list-page/best-companies-2024-methodology/) in approximately 2010 ([source](https://www.stjude.org/media-resources/news-releases/2019-medicine-science-news/st-jude-named-to-fortune-magazines-100-best-companies-to-work-for-for-ninth-consecutive-year.html)). The survey methods are overviewed at https://www.greatplacetowork.com/solutions/employee-surveys. 

#### CEO change and structured monthly soliciting, prioritizing, and responses to issues submitted by employees within a small, single hospital
St Jude appointed a new CEO, James Downing, in 2014. In 2015, the [2016-2015 strategic](https://www.stjude.org/content/dam/en_US/shared/www/about-st-jude/st-jude-strategic-plan-2015-external.pdf) plan noted:
> The CEO will initiate monthly town hall meetings to solicit input on key institutional efforts and issues. This new program will incorporate a page on the St. Jude intranet for employees to submit questions, rank the priority of the questions and see what questions will be discussed at upcoming town hall meetings.

Also relevant to the [job demands-resources model of burnout](http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/job.248]), in 2015 St Jude started expanding the workforce size ([St Jude link](https://www.stjude.org/media-resources/news-releases/2019-medicine-science-news/st-jude-named-to-fortune-magazines-100-best-companies-to-work-for-for-ninth-consecutive-year.html)).

In 2018, St Jude entered the Glassdoor top 50 ranking (see chart below) and Downing was rated as the #5 CEO by Glassdoor ([Glassdoor link](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/top-ceos-2018/)) According to a St Jude [news release](https://www.stjude.org/media-resources/news-releases/2018-medicine-science-news/st-jude-ceo-james-downing-ranked-no-5-of-glassdoors-top-100-ceos.html) noted
> "Under Downing’s leadership, St. Jude has increased employee feedback channels and forums, resulting in more innovation and connectivity across the Memphis-based campus. Downing leads monthly Town Hall and Blueprint Series all-employee meeting opportunities that encourage employees to share ideas and connect with leadership."

Accordingly, two publications of burunout rates in St Jude reported low rates in 2018:
* 28% by Maslach Burnout Inventory (high EE or high DP subscale) of 53 attending physicians in 2018 (Blazin et al. JCO Oncol Pract. 2021 PMID: [33720755](HTTP://pubmed.gov/33720755)).
* 34% by Maslach Burnout Inventory (high EE or high DP or high PA subscale) in 2018 among 65 physicians.  20% to 33% among other clinical staff groups (Dunn et al. Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 PMID: [34227729](HTTP://pubmed.gov/34227729))

In 2019, the burnout rate rose and in 2019, the Glassdoor ranking for St Jude fell (was not in the top 50 in 2020):
* 43% by the SIBOQ embedded in a Mini-Z survey of physicians. This equals an MBI rate of about 50% ([conversion details](https://ebmgt.github.io/well-being_measurement/)). (Raney et alL. JCO Oncol Pract. 2020 PMID: [32758084](HTTP://pubmed.gov/32758084)).

Probably not influencing rates of burnout at St Jude because of lack of temporal association, St Jude started using the AHRQ SOPS Hospital Survey in 2009 and biennially since ([AHRQ reports](https://www.ahrq.gov/news/newsroom/case-studies/cquips1402.html); [St Jude website](https://www.stjude.org/treatment/services/clinics-and-services/patient-safety.html)). In 2017 the [AHRQ reported](https://www.ahrq.gov/news/newsroom/case-studies/201709.html) that St Jude used AHRQ SOPS Hospital Survey to gather workforce feedback to change workflows to improve patient safety.

### Sloan-Kettering 2014-2015
Sloan-Kettering had successive years in the Glassdoor top 50 ranking. It is unclear what may have caused this during those two years.
