Does this plot show that ESG reporting, or internal reporting if accompanied by focused departmental and management support, can identify healthcare institutions with successful workforce environments?

The plot at the bottom of this page adds large healthcare institutions to the Google-Microsoft plot. 

### The Mayo Clinic data is plausible
While the quality of the Glassdoor data can be challenged due to the representativeness of the volunteer respondents, the non-specificity of what is being measured, and other concerns, the Mayo Clinic rankings are plausible and the results suggest the Mayo Clinic, like Google and Microsoft, required a similar number of years after introducing major organizational change before positive impact on Glassdoor rankings occurred.

According to a report by Shanafelt and Noseworthy in 2017, the Mayo Clinic started serially measuring well-being in 2010 and implemented hotspotting to help selected departments:
> We began systematically measuring burnout using standardized instruments in 2010. We also regularly measure engagement and satisfaction with work-life integration.
> Historically, we assessed these dimensions every 24 months, but we switched to annual assessment in 2016.
> We benchmark these measures against national data and use the information as a barometer of organizational health...
> Although anonymous at the level of the individual, results are aggregated at the work unit level (eg, division/department) to allow executive leadership to focus attention and resources where they are most needed.
 ([Shanafelt and Noseworthy, 2017](https://pubmed.gov/27871627))

> “Fundamentally, you manage what you measure,” argues Mayo Clinic President and Chief Executive Officer John Noseworthy. “CEO performance scorecards always include financial and quality measures, but mine also has staff engagement, satisfaction, and burnout measures that are reported up to the board of trustees.”
([Wright and Katz, 2018](https://pubmed.gov/29365301))

Shanafelt left the Mayo Clinic in 2017 and Noseworthy retired in 2018.

### St Jude efforts
Less information about efforts within St Jude is available. There are two descriptive studies (Blazin et al. JCO Oncol Pract. 2021 PMID: [33720755](HTTP://pubmed.gov/33720755); Dunn et al. Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2021 PMID: [34227729](HTTP://pubmed.gov/34227729)) and one intervention study (Raney et alL. JCO Oncol Pract. 2020 PMID: [32758084](HTTP://pubmed.gov/32758084)). In addition, in 2017 the AHRQ reported that St Jude used an AHRQ survey to gather workforce feedback to change workflows to improve patient safety ([AHRQ link](https://www.ahrq.gov/news/newsroom/case-studies/201709.html)).

St Jude appointed a new CEO, James Downing, in 2014 and he was rated as the #5 CEO by Glassdoor in 2018 ([Glassdoor link](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/top-ceos-2018/)). At that time, St Jude noted "Under Downing’s leadership, St. Jude has increased employee feedback channels and forums, resulting in more innovation and connectivity across the Memphis-based campus. Downing leads monthly Town Hall and Blueprint Series all-employee meeting opportunities that encourage employees to share ideas and connect with leadership"([St Jude link](https://www.stjude.org/media-resources/news-releases/2018-medicine-science-news/st-jude-ceo-james-downing-ranked-no-5-of-glassdoors-top-100-ceos.html)). In 2015, St Jude started expanding the workforce size ([St Jude link](https://www.stjude.org/media-resources/news-releases/2019-medicine-science-news/st-jude-named-to-fortune-magazines-100-best-companies-to-work-for-for-ninth-consecutive-year.html)).
